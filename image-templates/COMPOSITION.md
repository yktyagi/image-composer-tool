# Composing templates

You have a template that builds the image you want, and now you need a variant:
the same thing plus a driver, plus a package set, plus one config command.
Copying 250 lines of YAML works until the day the original changes and the copy
does not.

Two features avoid the copy:

- **`extends:`** — inherit another template and declare only the difference.
  Everything is resolved at build time from source templates.
- **overlay mode** (`baseline:` + `overlayPolicy:`) — install packages into an
  image that has already been built, without rebuilding it.

They answer different questions. `extends:` is for *authoring* a family of
related images. Overlay is for *adding to a finished artifact* you already have.

---

## `extends:`

```yaml
extends: "ubuntu24-x86_64-minimal-raw.yml"

image:
  name: my-image
  version: "24.04"

target:
  os: ubuntu          # must match the parent exactly
  dist: ubuntu24
  arch: x86_64
  imageType: raw

systemConfig:
  name: my-config
  packages:
    - htop            # added on top of the parent's packages
```

`ubuntu24/ubuntu24-x86_64-extends-example-raw.yml` is that example, ready to run.

### Two rules constrain where a parent can live

**The parent must be in the child's own directory** (or below it). The path is
resolved relative to the child, and anything that climbs out is rejected:

```
extends path escapes child template's directory: /…/ubuntu24-x86_64-minimal-raw.yml
```

So `extends: "../ubuntu24/minimal.yml"` does not work, and neither does a shared
`_base/` directory one level up. **Every template in a chain is a sibling.**
This is enforced twice, once lexically and once after resolving symlinks, in
`resolveExtendsParentPath` and `verifyResolvedContainment`
(`internal/config/merge.go`).

**Every level must share the same target** — `os`, `dist`, `arch` *and*
`imageType`:

```
extends target mismatch at level 1: child targets ubuntu/ubuntu24/x86_64/iso but parent targets ubuntu/ubuntu24/x86_64/raw
```

A practical consequence: a `-raw` and a `-iso` template **cannot share a
parent**, however similar they are. `ubuntu24-x86_64-robotics-jazzy-raw.yml` and
`…-iso.yml` have the same 37 packages, the same 7 repositories and the same 12
commands, and there is currently no way to factor that out.

Together these two rules are why this directory is grouped by distribution: any
grouping drawn from `{os, dist, arch, imageType}` can never split a chain.

### How layers combine

Chains are single-inheritance and linear: `root → … → leaf`, no diamonds. The OS
defaults sit underneath everything:

```
OS defaults → root template → … → leaf template
```

| Section | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `systemConfig.packages` | **union**, de-duplicated, child appended after parent |
| `systemConfig.configurations` | **concatenated**, root first, leaf last, no de-duplication |
| `packageRepositories` | merged **by `codename`** — a match *overrides*, a new codename appends |
| `disk` | **replaced as a whole block** when the child provides one |
| `systemConfig.users` | merged by `name` |
| `systemConfig.additionalFiles` | merged by `final` destination path |
| `systemConfig.kernel`, `.bootloader`, `.network` | per-field override |
| `systemConfig.immutability`, `.fde` | merged only if the child provides the section |
| `image.name`, `image.version`, scalars | non-empty child value wins |
| `target` | replaced wholesale |
| `metadata` | **not inherited at all** — see below |
| `extends` | stripped from the merged output |

Chains deeper than 4 levels log a warning but still build.

### Four things that will surprise you

**1. You cannot remove an inherited package.** Package lists are a union and
there is no removal syntax. If the parent installs it, so does the child.

This decides which parent you pick: inheriting a heavier base drags in packages
the child never uses and cannot drop — a template that boots with systemd-boot,
for instance, still inherits any GRUB packages its parent installs. Choosing the
leanest workable parent is how you keep that cost down.

**2. Repositories with the same codename collapse.** `packageRepositories` merge
by `codename`, and a match overrides the first existing entry rather than
appending. Duplicate codenames survive only inside a single layer, where the
merge returns the child list untouched.

This is easy to trigger and silent when it happens. A parent declaring one
`noble` repository plus a child declaring two yields **one**:

```yaml
# parent.yml
packageRepositories:
  - codename: "noble"
    url: "https://parent.example/ros2"
# child.yml  ->  resolves to ONE repository: child.example/realsense
packageRepositories:
  - codename: "noble"
    url: "https://child.example/gazebo"
  - codename: "noble"
    url: "https://child.example/realsense"
```

The robotics templates declare three repositories all codenamed `noble` (ROS 2,
Gazebo, RealSense). Split them across layers and two package sources disappear
with no error. **Keep a repository set in one layer**, and check the result with
`resolve --full` whenever you move one.

**3. `metadata` does not inherit.** It is valid in the schema, but there is no
corresponding field on `ImageTemplate`, so it is discarded at parse time. It
feeds template discovery and search, read per file. Every template needs its own
`metadata` block, including children.

**4. `disk` is all-or-nothing.** Providing any `disk` in a child replaces the
parent's block entirely rather than merging field by field. To change only the
size, restate the whole layout. Note `disk.name` is only ever logged — it does
not affect output paths or partitioning, which key off `systemConfig.name`.

Also worth knowing: `configurations` are concatenated in chain order, so a
parent's commands always run first. And `users` and `additionalFiles` are
de-duplicated through a map, so their **order in the merged output is not
stable** between runs; do not depend on it.

### Splitting a template safely

The candidates that work cleanly are the ones where the child's package set is a
**superset** of the parent's — then inheriting adds nothing unwanted. In this
directory that was true of the EMT3 and Debian families:

```
emt3-x86_64-edge-raw.yml            41 packages
  -> emt3-x86_64-emf-raw.yml        +2
  |    -> emt3-x86_64-emf-rt-raw.yml  + real-time GPU driver
  -> emt3-x86_64-dlstreamer.yml     +8, +3 repositories
```

Watch out for **order-coupled packages**. The robotics templates list
`intel-oneapi-runtime-*` before `ros-jazzy-desktop` so the resolver pins those
versions first. Because child packages are appended after the parent's, a split
that puts them in different layers can reorder them. Keep order-coupled entries
in the same layer, and mark them — the robotics template uses an
`ORDER-COUPLED:` comment.

Before and after any split, compare the resolved output:

```bash
./image-composer-tool resolve <template> --full > /tmp/before.yml
# ...split the template...
./image-composer-tool resolve <template> --full > /tmp/after.yml
diff /tmp/before.yml /tmp/after.yml
```

Expect differences in `metadata`, `image.name` and `disk.name`, and in
`packageRepositories` when the parent declares repositories the child did not.
Anything else means the image changed.

That fourth case is easy to overlook, so check it deliberately. The EMT3 chain is
the worked example: `emt3-x86_64-edge-raw.yml` declares three sample repositories
(`company-internal`, `dev-tools`, `intel-openvino`) whose URLs are the literal
placeholder `<URL>`, so `emf-raw` and `emf-rt-raw` resolve to three repositories
where their standalone versions had none, and `dlstreamer` resolves to six rather
than three.

An inherited-repository diff is benign only when the added entries are inert or
already present. Those three are inert on two counts — `rpmutils` skips any
repository whose URL is `<URL>` before fetching, and EMT3 is RPM-based so
apt-source generation never runs for it. If the inherited entries are *real*
repositories, they change what the resolver can see, and you have changed the
image. Check the URLs, not just the count.

## Overlay mode

Overlay installs packages into an image that already exists. The baseline is
copied into the workspace first and is never modified in place.

```yaml
baseline:
  mode: overlay
  source:
    path: /path/to/ubuntu-24.04-base.img   # or url: https://…
    format: raw                            # raw | qcow2 | vhd | vhdx

overlayPolicy:
  packageOperation: additive-only
  conflictPolicy: fail

systemConfig:
  name: overlay
  packages:
    - tree
    - jq
```

`ubuntu24/ubuntu24-x86_64-overlay-raw.yml` is that example. Its `source.path` is
a deliberate placeholder, so point it at a real baseline before building.

Rules the loader enforces:

- `mode: overlay` **requires** `baseline.source`, with exactly one of `path` or
  `url`. A `url` must be `https`.
- `overlayPolicy` is only allowed when `mode` is `overlay`. Because `mode`
  defaults to `create`, a template that sets `overlayPolicy` without a
  `baseline` is rejected.
- Overlay is additive by default: packages are added, never removed or
  downgraded, and a conflict fails the preflight gate. `packageOperation:
  additive-and-upgrade` also permits upgrading a present baseline package, and
  `allowPackageRemoval: true` permits conflict-driven removal of a non-kernel
  baseline package.
- The bootloader binary and ESP are always left alone. The kernel is left alone
  too, unless `overlayPolicy.replaceKernel` is set — that swaps the kernel
  (install the new one, remove the baseline kernel family) and regenerates the
  GRUB config to boot it. See the templates reference for details, and
  `ubuntu24/ubuntu24-x86_64-overlay-replace-kernel-raw.yml` for an example.

**Overlay changes the package rule.** Normally packages are a union; in overlay
mode the merged list is *exactly* what the template declares. The baseline
already ships the base toolchain, and unioning it back in would drag in
bootloader packages whose pinned versions the frozen baseline cannot satisfy.

### Combining overlay with `extends`

The two features compose, and this is the most useful shape in the directory: an
overlay **base** that layers onto a vendor image, plus a **child** that extends
the base to add a workload. The Ubuntu robotics pair does exactly that:

```
Canonical noble cloud image (qcow2, never modified in place)
  -> ubuntu24-x86_64-robotics-hw-overlay-qcow2.yml        Intel oneAPI / Level Zero / NPU / RealSense
       -> ubuntu24-x86_64-robotics-jazzy-overlay-extends.yml  + ROS 2 Jazzy, OpenVINO, Gazebo, SLAM
```

**The child must declare neither `baseline` nor `overlayPolicy`.** This is not a
style preference — it decides whether the child's packages are *added* or
*substituted*:

```
child WITHOUT baseline -> packages: [parent's…, child's…]   additive
child WITH    baseline -> packages: [child's…]              parent's packages LOST
```

Why: `MergeConfigurations` replaces the package list outright when the template
being merged is itself overlay-mode, and `IsOverlayMode()` is true exactly when
`baseline` is non-nil. A child that omits `baseline` is not overlay-mode *at its
own layer*, so the restriction never fires and the lists accumulate. Declaring
`baseline` in the child flips that silently — no error, just a smaller image.

`overlayPolicy` on its own is worse than useless: it fails validation before the
merge even happens, because the leaf is validated as a standalone file first and
`overlayPolicy` is only legal alongside `baseline.mode: overlay`.

Two more consequences of the same merge order, both load-bearing:

- **Parent packages are prepended.** Put order-coupled packages in the parent and
  the ordering becomes structural. The robotics base holds the
  `intel-oneapi-runtime-*` trio precisely so it resolves ahead of the child's
  `ros-jazzy-desktop`, which is the ordering the resolver needs.
- **Repositories belong in one layer.** The base declares all seven robotics
  repositories and the child declares none. Three of them share the codename
  `noble`; splitting them across layers would collapse them (see trap 2 above).

Growing a vendor baseline needs `overlayPolicy.allowDiskResize: true` *and* a
`disk.size` larger than the baseline. The resize path also needs a build host with
util-linux ≥ 2.38 (Ubuntu 24.04+): it reads partition start sectors via
`lsblk -o PATH,START,TYPE`, and the `START` column does not exist on older hosts —
Ubuntu 22.04 fails with `lsblk: unknown column: START,TYPE`.

## Debugging

```bash
# the chain only, without OS defaults — good for checking inheritance
./image-composer-tool resolve image-templates/emt3/emt3-x86_64-emf-rt-raw.yml

# everything, exactly as the build will see it
./image-composer-tool resolve image-templates/emt3/emt3-x86_64-emf-rt-raw.yml --full
```

`resolve` prints the chain it walked:

```
Extends chain: emt3-x86_64-edge-raw.yml -> emt3-x86_64-emf-raw.yml -> emt3-x86_64-emf-rt-raw.yml
```

Passwords, hash algorithms and secure-boot key paths are redacted, so the output
is safe to paste into an issue.

One caveat: `resolve` prints `additionalFiles.local` values as written, not as
resolved. A path that no longer resolves is dropped at build time with a
`Ignoring additional file entry with non-existent local path` warning, which
`resolve` will not show you. Relative `local:` paths are resolved against the
directory of each template in the chain, so a path that worked before a move may
need a `../` after it.
