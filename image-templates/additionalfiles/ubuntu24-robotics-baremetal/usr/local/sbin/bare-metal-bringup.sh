# bare-metal-bringup.sh — first-/every-boot bring-up for an Ubuntu cloud image
# flashed to bare metal, where there is NO cloud-init datasource.
#
# The Ubuntu generic cloud image expects cloud-init to configure networking and
# SSH from a metadata datasource at first boot. On bare metal there is no
# datasource, so networking and sshd never come up — the device gets no IP and
# SSH never starts. This script performs that bring-up directly:
#
#   1. DHCP every wired NIC via systemd-networkd (always present with systemd),
#   2. generate PER-DEVICE SSH host keys, enable password auth, start sshd.
#
# It is idempotent — safe to run repeatedly (the MODE A oneshot runs it on every
# boot, and it is safe to re-run by hand). Only MODE A actually runs it (see the
# image template's MODE toggle):
#   * MODE A (no cloud-init): run by the bare-metal-bringup.service systemd oneshot.
#   * MODE B (cloud-init):    shipped but left inert; cloud-init provisions
#                             networking/SSH from the datasource instead (no local
#                             NoCloud seed is baked — it would shadow that datasource).
#
# This script is deliberately MODE-AGNOSTIC: it does NOT touch cloud-init. Whether
# cloud-init is disabled is the template's decision (MODE A disables it at build;
# MODE B keeps it enabled), so the same script is correct under both invokers.
# Run it by hand for recovery:  sudo bare-metal-bringup.sh
#
# INSECURE BRING-UP: this enables PASSWORD SSH auth. Before any real deployment,
# switch to key-based auth and remove /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/00-baremetal.conf.
#
# It also does NOT create a login user — the login account is provisioned by the
# image template (systemConfig.users). Without a user, password SSH has nothing
# to log into.

# Keep going if an individual step fails (no `set -e`), but REMEMBER failures of
# required steps in `rc` so the oneshot still exits nonzero — otherwise a broken
# bring-up (no IP / no SSH) would report success under RemainAfterExit=yes.
# Optional steps (systemd-resolved, unit enablement) stay best-effort.

# --- 1. Networking: DHCP on every wired interface ----------------------------
# systemd-networkd ships with systemd, so this works without ifupdown / netplan /
# NetworkManager being installed. Match every wired NIC by DEVICE TYPE (Type=ether)
# rather than by name prefix: predictable names are not guaranteed to start with
# `en` (e.g. `eth0` under net.ifnames=0, or vendor/board names), and Type=ether
# still excludes loopback and WiFi (Type=wlan).
#
# ClientIdentifier=mac is REQUIRED for bare metal: by default networkd sends an
# RFC-4361 DUID as the DHCP client id, but many bare-metal DHCP servers lease by
# MAC (reservations / per-MAC pools) and ignore the DUID — so you get no lease or
# a different address than expected. Sending the raw MAC matches those servers.
# IPv6AcceptRA=no stops the NIC coming "up" with only an RA-derived IPv6 address
# and no usable IPv4. (QEMU's slirp DHCP leases regardless, which masked this.)
#
# Caveat (MODE B): if cloud-init is left enabled and also renders a network
# config (Ubuntu's default netplan → systemd-networkd), both request DHCP on the
# same NIC — harmless (they converge on the same lease), but for a real
# deployment pick ONE network manager.
