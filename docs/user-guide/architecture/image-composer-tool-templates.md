# Image Template Reference

<!-- markdownlint-configure-file {"MD051": false, "MD060": false} -->

Templates are YAML files that define what goes into a custom OS image, the
target platform, packages, disk layout, users, and build-time customizations.
This document is the authoritative field-by-field reference for the template
format.

For a conceptual overview of how templates fit into the build pipeline, see
[Understanding the Build Process](./image-composer-tool-build-process.md).

## What Are Templates and How Do They Work?

Templates are predefined build specifications that serve as a foundation for
building operating system images. Here's what templates empower you to do:

- Create standardized baseline configurations.
- Impose consistency across multiple images.
- Reduce duplication of effort.
- Share and reuse common configurations with your team.

The ICT provides default image templates on a per-distribution
basis and image type (RAW vs. ISO) that can be used directly to build an
operating system from those defaults. You can override these default templates
by providing your own template and configure or override the settings and
values you want. The tool will internally merge the two to create the final
template used for image composition.

![image-templates](../_assets/template.drawio.svg)

## How Templates Work

ICT ships **default templates** for each distribution and image
type (raw, ISO, initrd). When you provide a user template, the tool merges it
with the matching default; your values override or extend the defaults. The
merged result is validated against a JSON schema before the build begins.

![image-templates](../_assets/template.drawio.svg)

Default templates live at:

```text
config/osv/<target.os>/<target.dist>/imageconfigs/defaultconfigs/default-<imageType>-<arch>.yml
```

> **Note:** `imageType: img` maps to `default-initrd-<arch>.yml` (there is no
> `default-img-` filename).

You do not need to edit the defaults. You can start from one of the examples in
`image-templates/` and override only what you need.

## Quick Start Example

A minimal user template only needs `image`, `target`, and optionally
`systemConfig` with extra packages:

```yaml
image:
  name: my-edge-device
  version: "1.0.0"

target:
  os: edge-microvisor-toolkit
  dist: emt3
  arch: x86_64
  imageType: raw

systemConfig:
  name: edge
  packages:
    - cloud-init
    - rsyslog
```

Everything else (disk layout, bootloader, kernel, default packages) comes from
the default template for `emt3 / raw / x86_64`.

## Top-Level Structure

A template file has up to five top-level sections plus an optional `metadata`
block:

```yaml
metadata:       # Optional - AI-searchable discovery metadata
  ...
image:          # Required - image name and version
  ...
target:         # Required - OS, distribution, architecture, image type
  ...
baseline:       # Optional - "create" (default) or "overlay" an existing image
  ...
overlayPolicy:  # Optional - overlay-mode policy (only with baseline.mode: overlay)
  ...
disk:           # Optional - disk layout, partitions, output artifacts
  ...
packageRepositories:  # Optional - additional package repositories
  - ...
systemConfig:   # Required in merged template - packages, kernel, users, etc.
  ...
```

> **Note:** **User templates** require only `image` and `target`. The remaining sections
> are merged from the default template if omitted.

## Field Reference

### `metadata`

Optional block for AI-powered template discovery. Ignored by the build engine.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `description` | string | Human-readable description of the template |
| `use_cases` | string[] | Use cases this template targets |
| `keywords` | string[] | Keywords for search and discovery |

```yaml
metadata:
  description: "Edge device image with container runtime"
  use_cases: ["edge computing", "IoT gateway"]
  keywords: [edge, docker, emt3]
```

---

### `image` (required)

Image identification. Both fields are required.

| Field | Type | Required | Validation | Description |
|-------|------|----------|------------|-------------|
| `name` | string | **Yes** | `^[a-zA-Z0-9]([a-zA-Z0-9\-_]*[a-zA-Z0-9])?$` | Image name (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores) |
| `version` | string | **Yes** | Semver-like: `1.0.0`, `24.04`, `1.0.0+build1` | Version string |

```yaml
image:
  name: my-edge-device
  version: "1.0.0"
```

---

### `target` (required)

Target platform. All four fields are required.

| Field | Type | Required | Valid Values | Description |
|-------|------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| `os` | string | **Yes** | `azure-linux`, `edge-microvisor-toolkit`, `wind-river-elxr`, `ubuntu`, `redhat-compatible-distro` | Target operating system |
| `dist` | string | **Yes** | See OS constraints below | Distribution identifier |
| `arch` | string | **Yes** | `x86_64`, `aarch64`, `armv7hl` | Target CPU architecture |
| `imageType` | string | **Yes** | `raw`, `iso`, `img`, `wsl2` | Output image format |

**OS → dist constraints:**

| OS | Valid `dist` |
|----|-------------|
| `azure-linux` | `azl3` |
| `edge-microvisor-toolkit` | `emt3` |
| `wind-river-elxr` | `elxr12` |
| `ubuntu` | `ubuntu24`, `ubuntu26` |
| `redhat-compatible-distro` | Any (e.g., `el10`) |

```yaml
target:
  os: ubuntu
  dist: ubuntu24
  arch: x86_64
  imageType: raw
```

### WSL-Compatible Images

Set `target.imageType: wsl2` to compose a WSL-compatible root filesystem.

```yaml
target:
  os: ubuntu
  dist: ubuntu24
  arch: x86_64
  imageType: wsl2
```

For a complete Ubuntu 24 WSL example, see
[`image-templates/ubuntu24/ubuntu24-x86_64-agentic-wsl2.yml`](../../image-templates/ubuntu24/ubuntu24-x86_64-agentic-wsl2.yml).

---

### `baseline`

Selects how the image is assembled. If omitted, the build defaults to **create**
mode (build the image from scratch, the behavior described everywhere else in
this reference). Set `mode: overlay` to instead layer packages onto an existing
baseline disk image without rebuilding it. The baseline may be a RAW image or a
qcow2/vhd/vhdx image, which is converted to RAW before the overlay runs.

| Field | Type | Required | Valid Values | Description |
|-------|------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| `mode` | string | No | `create` (default), `overlay` | Assembly mode |
| `source` | object | **Yes** when `mode: overlay` (must be **absent** for `create`) | — | The baseline image to overlay |

#### `baseline.source`

Identifies the baseline image. Exactly one of `path` or `url` must be set.
The source is copied into the build workspace first and is **never modified in
place**.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | string | one of `path`/`url` | Local filesystem path to the baseline image (no URI scheme) |
| `url` | string | one of `path`/`url` | `https://` URL of the baseline image; downloaded over TLS before the overlay runs (plain `http` is rejected) |
| `format` | string | No | Baseline image format: `raw`, `qcow2`, `vhd` or `vhdx` (default `raw`). Non-raw formats are converted to RAW before the overlay runs |
| `sbomPath` | string | No | Local filesystem path (no URI scheme) to an externally-supplied SPDX SBOM (JSON) describing the baseline image. Defaults to unset. See [SBOM generation](#sbom-generation-overlay-mode) below |

```yaml
baseline:
  mode: overlay
  source:
    path: /path/to/ubuntu-24.04-base.img
    format: raw
    # Optional: combine this base-image SBOM with the overlay delta to emit a
    # full SBOM. Omit it to use the SBOM embedded in the baseline image, if any.
    sbomPath: /path/to/ubuntu-24.04-base.spdx.json
```

##### SBOM generation (overlay mode)

An overlay build emits SPDX SBOM sidecar files into the build output directory,
alongside the emitted image (`<image-name>-<version>.raw`):

| Artifact | Name | Contents |
|----------|------|----------|
| **Delta SBOM** | `<image-name>-<version>.delta.spdx.json` | Always emitted. Only the overlay-induced package changes — the packages the overlay added and, in `additive-and-upgrade` mode, upgraded. |
| **Complete SBOM** | `<image-name>-<version>.complete.spdx.json` | Emitted only when a base SBOM is available (see below). The full final image inventory — the baseline packages plus the overlay result. When no base SBOM exists the complete document would be identical to the delta, so this sidecar is skipped. |

Both are SPDX 2.3 JSON, the same format the standalone SBOM/inspect tooling uses.
The **complete** SBOM is also embedded inside the image at `/usr/share/sbom`
(replacing the SBOM the image inherited from the baseline, so the in-image
manifest reflects the full final inventory).

The complete SBOM is the union of a **base** SBOM and the overlay delta. Which
base is used follows this order:

1. **`baseline.source.sbomPath` set and valid** — that externally-supplied base
   SBOM is combined with the delta.
2. **`sbomPath` unset** — the SBOM the baseline image itself carries at
   `/usr/share/sbom` is used as the base and combined with the delta.
3. **No base SBOM available** — `sbomPath` is unset or the file is
   absent/unreadable/malformed **and** the baseline image embeds no SBOM — then
   there is no full inventory to build, so the **complete** sidecar is skipped
   (it would be identical to the delta) while the in-image `/usr/share/sbom`
   manifest and the **delta** sidecar are still written. This is never an error:
   the build succeeds.

A missing or malformed `sbomPath` falls back to the baseline-embedded SBOM (then
to delta-only); it does not fail the build. Omitting `sbomPath` entirely
preserves the pre-existing base-resolution behavior. This applies to every
overlay-capable provider (Ubuntu and Debian).

To diff these artifacts against the baseline — the overlay RAW vs the baseline
RAW, or the complete SBOM vs the baseline SBOM — see
[Comparing Overlay Outputs](../get-started/usage-guide.md#comparing-overlay-outputs).

> **Note:** Overlay mode is currently wired end-to-end for the **Ubuntu** and
> **Debian** providers. Targeting a provider without overlay support fails the
> build immediately with a clear message rather than silently falling back to a

>
> **OS defaults do not apply.** Unlike a create-mode build, an overlay template is

> baseline would otherwise be rejected as a shrink.
>
> **Unsupported systemConfig sections.** Because overlay mode does not re-run the
> boot/system-provisioning stages, the following `systemConfig` sections cannot be
> applied to an overlay build: `hostname`, `network`, `initramfs`, `kernel`,
> `immutability`, `fde`, and `bootloader`. Previously these were silently ignored;
> now setting any of them in an overlay template **fails the build up front** with
> a message naming every offending section. Configure them in the baseline image
> (a `create`-mode build) instead. The overlay-supported `systemConfig` inputs are
> `packages`, `users`, `configurations`, and `additionalFiles`.
>
> **Users in overlay.** `systemConfig.users` is provisioned onto the baseline. A
> requested user that **already exists in the baseline image fails the build up
> front** (an overlay cannot redefine a baseline account); the check is re-run
> immediately before creation, so a name that a package's maintainer script adds
> during install also fails rather than being silently modified. A user's
> `startupScript` must reference a path already present when users are created —
> i.e. shipped by the baseline or installed by an overlay `packages` entry — not a
> file delivered via `additionalFiles`, which are copied later in the overlay
> pipeline.
>
> The following `systemConfig.users` fields are **not currently applied** (an
> inherited create-mode limitation, in both create and overlay builds): `home`,
> `shell`, and `passwordMaxAge`. The login shell is always set to `/bin/bash`, so
> a service account cannot yet be pinned to `/usr/sbin/nologin` via the template.
>
> **Sizing:** Adding packages does **not** auto-grow the image, and the overlay
> preserves the baseline disk layout by default. Growing the image is opt-in: it
> requires **both** a `disk.size` larger than the baseline **and**
> `overlayPolicy.allowDiskResize: true`. When `disk.size` is larger but
> `allowDiskResize` is not set, the build fails early with a clear message rather
> than silently resizing the baseline. The resize is grow-only and keyed solely
> on `disk.size` (compared to the baseline's current size), not on how much space
> the added packages need. If the baseline root is near-full, set `disk.size`
> larger than the baseline image and enable `allowDiskResize` to make room;
> otherwise the package install step fails with a "no space left on device"
> error (the failure message points back here).
>
> **Resize constraints.** The grow-only resize extends the **last** partition on
> the disk and its filesystem in place. It is rejected (before any disk mutation,
> with an actionable error) when the root is **not** the last partition, when the
> root sits on **LVM**, and when the root is **LUKS-encrypted** or **dm-verity**
> protected. `ext4`/`ext3`/`ext2` roots are the supported and CI-covered target;
> `xfs` roots use the same code path (`xfs_growfs`) but are **best-effort**: the
> grow sequence has unit-test coverage, but no shipping baseline exercises it
> against a real xfs filesystem in CI/e2e, so treat xfs resize as unverified
> end-to-end. The resize shells out to `growpart` (cloud-guest-utils), `sgdisk`
> (gdisk, GPT only), `resize2fs` (e2fsprogs) or `xfs_growfs` (xfsprogs), and
> `losetup`/`partx` (util-linux); these must be present on the build host, and
> the build fails early with a clear message if any is missing. Resize also
> reads partition start sectors via `lsblk -o PATH,START,TYPE`, which requires
> **util-linux >= 2.38**; Ubuntu 22.04's stock `lsblk`/`resize2fs` are too old
> and not upgradable via `apt` — see the
> [util-linux/e2fsprogs build-from-source instructions](../get-started/prerequisites.md#util-linux-lsblk-and-e2fsprogs-resize2fs).
>
> **Output formats.** Overlay honors [`disk.artifacts`](#diskartifacts) exactly as
> a create-mode build does: every supported output format (`raw`, `qcow2`, `vhd`,
> `vhdx`, `vmdk`, `vdi`, `tar`) and compression build mode is available. The

### `overlayPolicy`

Optional policy controls for overlay-mode preflight and install. It is a
top-level peer of `baseline` and may **only** be set when `baseline.mode` is
`overlay`. If omitted, the defaults below apply.

| Field | Type | Required | Valid Values | Description |
|-------|------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| `packageOperation` | string | No | `additive-only` (default), `additive-and-upgrade` | Permitted package operations. `additive-only`: packages may only be added, never removed or downgraded. `additive-and-upgrade`: also permits upgrading a package already present in the baseline to a newer version. Downgrades and removals remain blocked in both modes (see note below) |
| `conflictPolicy` | string | No | `fail` (default), `allow-explicit` | How a package conflict detected during preflight is handled. `fail` aborts the build; `allow-explicit` permits a conflict only when the conflicting package was explicitly requested |
| `kernelCmdline` | string | No | — | Optional kernel command-line override applied to the overlaid image (full-line replacement of `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` on a GRUB2 baseline). Must not contain a double quote, dollar sign, backtick, backslash, or newline |
| `grubDefault` | string | No | — | Optional `GRUB_DEFAULT` override (pins the default boot menu entry, e.g. the Ubuntu submenu path `Advanced options for Ubuntu>Ubuntu, with Linux <ver>`). Only applied on a GRUB2 baseline. Same character restrictions as `kernelCmdline` |
| `allowDiskResize` | boolean | No | `false` (default), `true` | Permit growing the baseline image to satisfy a larger `disk.size`. Overlay mode preserves the baseline disk layout by default; when `false`, a `disk.size` larger than the baseline is rejected with an error. Resize is always grow-only and never shrinks the image |
| `allowPackageRemoval` | boolean | No | `false` (default), `true` | Permit removing a baseline package that a to-install package conflicts with (e.g. installing `dracut`, which conflicts with `initramfs-tools`). When `false` (the default) such a conflict fails the build; when `true`, the conflicting baseline package is removed before install. **Only valid with `packageOperation: additive-and-upgrade`** — removal is more invasive than an in-place upgrade, so it is rejected under the default `additive-only`. Bootloader and bootable-kernel packages are never removed regardless of this flag (to swap the kernel, use `replaceKernel`) |
| `replaceKernel` | object | No | `{ package: <name> }` | Replace the baseline kernel: install the named kernel package and remove the baseline kernel family (image + meta + modules + headers) so the image ships **only** the new kernel, then regenerate the GRUB menu to default to it. The ESP and bootloader binary are never touched (no `grub-install`, no Secure Boot re-signing). **Only valid with `packageOperation: additive-and-upgrade`**; does **not** require `allowPackageRemoval` (it self-authorizes its own kernel-family removals). See the note below |

> **`additive-and-upgrade` scope.** Upgrades apply only to the package set: a
> package already installed in the baseline may be replaced by a newer version
> when the resolved overlay closure requires it. Downgrades are still rejected at
> preflight. The bootloader binary remains immutable in all cases, and the kernel
> is immutable **unless** you explicitly opt into a swap with `replaceKernel` (see
> below) — an overlay never upgrades a kernel image in place or reinstalls the
> bootloader, regardless of `packageOperation`. Choose `additive-only` (the
> default) to fail the build on any version bump to a baseline package.

> **Package removal (`allowPackageRemoval`).** Opt-in, and permitted **only under
> `packageOperation: additive-and-upgrade`** — removal is more invasive than an
> in-place upgrade, so pairing it with the default `additive-only` is rejected at
> validation. By default an overlay never removes a baseline package: a to-install
> package that `Conflicts:`/`Breaks:` a present baseline package fails the build.
> Set `allowPackageRemoval: true` (with `additive-and-upgrade`) to let the overlay
> remove the conflicting baseline package before installing its replacement — the
> case that makes `dracut` (which conflicts with `initramfs-tools`) installable on
> a stock baseline. Bootloader and bootable-kernel packages are still never
> removed, so the flag cannot break the boot path.
>
> **Cascade removal of orphaned reverse-dependencies.** A conflict-driven removal
> can leave an unrelated baseline package that only `Depends:` on the removed one
> with an unmet dependency (for example, the Debian cloud image's
> `cloud-initramfs-growroot` depends on `initramfs-tools`). When
> `allowPackageRemoval` is enabled, the post-install dependency audit turns into a
> bounded cascade: each baseline package that is broken *after* a removal but was
> whole *before* it is itself removed, transitively, until the package manager's
> own check (`apt-get check` / `dnf check`) reports the dependency tree is whole
> again. A dependency that an alternative still satisfies is never treated as broken, so
> nothing is over-removed. The cascade still fails **closed**: if resolving the
> breakage would require removing a bootloader/kernel-image package or a package
> the overlay is installing, the build fails instead. Cascade removals are folded
> into the package statistics and the complete SBOM so the final inventory is
> accurate. This behavior is entirely gated by `allowPackageRemoval`; when it is
> `false`, a removal that would orphan another package fails the build as before.

```yaml
baseline:
  mode: overlay
  source:
    path: /path/to/ubuntu-24.04-base.img

overlayPolicy:
  # Removal requires additive-and-upgrade (not the default additive-only).
  packageOperation: additive-and-upgrade
  conflictPolicy: fail

  # Opt in to removing a baseline package a new package conflicts with
  # (e.g. remove initramfs-tools so dracut can install). Default: false.
  allowPackageRemoval: true
```

A complete **additive-only** starter template (the default policy, without package
removal) lives at
[`image-templates/ubuntu24/ubuntu24-x86_64-overlay-raw.yml`](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/image-composer-tool/blob/main/image-templates/ubuntu24/ubuntu24-x86_64-overlay-raw.yml);
to enable removal, add the `overlayPolicy` block shown above (`additive-and-upgrade`
plus `allowPackageRemoval: true`) to it.

> **Kernel replacement (`replaceKernel`).** By default the baseline kernel is
> immutable: an overlay may *add* a new kernel alongside the existing one (a
> version-qualified `linux-image-*` package is an addition, and GRUB gains a menu
> entry for it), but it never upgrades or removes an installed kernel image. Set
> `overlayPolicy.replaceKernel.package: <kernel-package>` to perform a **full
> swap** instead:
>
> 1. the named replacement kernel is resolved from the configured repositories and
>    installed (like any other overlay package);
> 2. the baseline kernel **family** — the bootable image plus its meta-package,
>    modules, and headers (e.g. `linux-image-6.8.0-40-generic`,
>    `linux-image-generic`, `linux-modules-*`, `linux-headers-*`) — is auto-detected
>    and removed, so the emitted image ships **only** the new kernel;
> 3. the GRUB config is regenerated so the removed kernel's menu entry is dropped
>    and `GRUB_DEFAULT` points at the new kernel (auto-pinned to `"0"` when you do
>    not set `grubDefault` explicitly).
>
> Only the GRUB **config** on the writable root is updated — the ESP and the
> bootloader binary are never touched (no `grub-install`), matching the overlay
> read-only-ESP contract. On a Secure Boot baseline the newly installed kernel may
> be **unsigned**; overlay does not re-sign it, so sign it out of band if the image
> must boot under Secure Boot. `replaceKernel` requires
> `packageOperation: additive-and-upgrade` but does **not** require
> `allowPackageRemoval` — the two are orthogonal (`allowPackageRemoval` governs
> conflict-driven removal of *non-kernel* baseline packages). A `replaceKernel` set
> on a non-GRUB2 baseline is a hard error. Userspace kernel-adjacent packages
> (`linux-libc-dev`, `linux-tools-common`, rpm `kernel-headers`/`kernel-devel`) are
> **not** removed.

```yaml
baseline:
  mode: overlay
  source:
    path: /path/to/ubuntu-24.04-base.img

overlayPolicy:
  # A kernel swap requires additive-and-upgrade (not the default additive-only).
  packageOperation: additive-and-upgrade
  conflictPolicy: fail

  # Install this kernel and remove the baseline kernel family. GRUB_DEFAULT is
  # auto-pinned to the new kernel unless grubDefault is set below.
  replaceKernel:
    package: linux-image-6.11.0-1004-oem

  # Optional: the exact command line the new kernel boots with.
  # kernelCmdline: "quiet splash"
  # Optional: pin a specific GRUB entry instead of the auto "0" default.
  # grubDefault: "Advanced options for Ubuntu>Ubuntu, with Linux 6.11.0-1004-oem"
```

A complete kernel-replacement example lives at
[`image-templates/ubuntu24/ubuntu24-x86_64-overlay-replace-kernel-raw.yml`](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/image-composer-tool/blob/main/image-templates/ubuntu24/ubuntu24-x86_64-overlay-replace-kernel-raw.yml).

### `disk`

Disk layout, partition scheme, and output artifact formats. If omitted, the
default template provides sensible values (typically 4–6 GiB GPT disk with EFI
boot and ext4 root partitions).

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | **Yes** (schema) | Disk configuration name (e.g., `"Default_Raw"`) |
| `path` | string | No | Disk device path (used by live installer, e.g., `/dev/sda`) |

#### `systemConfig.additionalFiles[]`

Copy host files into the image at build time.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `local` | string | Source path on the host (absolute, or relative to template directory) |
| `final` | string | Destination path inside the image |
| `stage` | string | Overlay-only. When to copy the file relative to initramfs/boot regeneration: `""` (default) copies at the end of the build, after regeneration; `pre-initramfs` copies **before** boot/initramfs regeneration so the generator can consume it. Ignored by create-mode builds |

```yaml
systemConfig:
  additionalFiles:
    - local: files/dhcp.network
      final: /etc/systemd/network/dhcp.network
    - local: files/motd
      final: /etc/motd
    # A dracut module must be in place BEFORE the initramfs is (re)built, or the
    # already-built initramfs would ignore it — mark it pre-initramfs.
    - local: files/90-custom.conf
      final: /usr/lib/dracut/dracut.conf.d/90-custom.conf
      stage: pre-initramfs
```

> **Overlay mode:** `additionalFiles` are honored in overlay builds, and each
> entry's copy timing is controlled by its `stage` marker:
>
> - **`stage: ""` (default)** — copied as the **last** build step, after both
>   initramfs and GRUB regeneration. This is the historical behavior, so existing
>   templates are unaffected. It is deliberate: a prebuilt boot artifact (for
>   example a custom `/boot/initrd.img-*`) dropped here survives, whereas a file
>   placed before regeneration would be overwritten by `update-initramfs`.
> - **`stage: pre-initramfs`** — copied **before** boot/initramfs regeneration, so
>   content the generator consumes (a dracut module under `/usr/lib/dracut`, an
>   initramfs-tools hook under `/etc/initramfs-tools/`) is in place when the
>   initramfs is rebuilt. Without this, such a file dropped at the end would be
>   ignored by the already-built initramfs.
>
> A file only needs `pre-initramfs` when the initramfs build must see it; a file
> that must instead run a generator itself still belongs in a
> [`systemConfig.configurations`](#systemconfigconfigurations) command.

#### `systemConfig.configurations[]`

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `cmd` | string | Shell command to execute |

```yaml
systemConfig:
  configurations:
    - cmd: systemctl enable docker
    - cmd: echo "BuildDate=$(date)" >> /etc/image-info
```

## Package Repositories

Use `packageRepositories` to add extra Debian or RPM repositories to a build.
Each entry defines where to fetch package metadata and how candidates are
selected when the same package exists in multiple repositories.

### Repository Fields

- `codename`: repository identifier.
- `url`: repository base URL.
- `component`: optional Debian component (for example, `main`, `universe`) for multi-component repositories.
- `pkey`: GPG key reference; supports `http://`/`https://` URLs, `file://` URLs, absolute local paths, or `[trusted=yes]` for supported Debian flows.
- `priority`: numeric repository preference used in conflict resolution.
- `allowPackages`: optional package white list for metadata filtering.

### Priority Behavior

`priority` is evaluated during package candidate selection across repositories.

- Higher numeric values are preferred.
- Debian resolver also supports APT-like behavior:
  - `< 0`: block packages from that repository
  - `990`: prefer over default repositories
  - `1000`: install even if lower version
  - `> 1000`: force preference

When candidates have equivalent priority, version constraints and dependency
context determine the final package choice.

### AllowPackages White List

`allowPackages` limits which package names are indexed from a specific
repository.

- If omitted or empty, all repository packages are eligible.
- If present, only matching package names are indexed.
- Supported matching modes:
  - exact name (for example `spice-server`)
  - prefix/version pin (for example `kernel-6.17.11`)
  - glob patterns (for example `libva*`, `wayland*`)

Filtering happens at metadata-parse time, before dependency resolution.

## Template Merge Behavior

When your user template is merged with the default template, different sections
follow different strategies:

| Section | Strategy |
|---------|----------|
| `image.name`, `image.version` | User overrides default if non-empty |
| `target` | User value used entirely |
| `disk` | User replaces entire default if non-empty |
| `systemConfig.packages` | **Additive** - user packages appended to defaults (deduplicated) |
| `systemConfig.kernel` | User overrides `version`, `cmdline`, `packages` individually if non-empty |
| `systemConfig.bootloader` | User overrides individual fields if non-empty |
| `systemConfig.network` | User overrides `backend` if non-empty; `interfaces` replaced when provided |
| `systemConfig.users` | Merged by `name` - same-name users merged field-by-field; new users appended |
| `systemConfig.additionalFiles` | Merged by `final` path - same destination overrides; new files appended |
| `systemConfig.configurations` | **Additive** - user commands appended after defaults |
| `systemConfig.immutability` | Merged only if user explicitly provides the section |
| `systemConfig.fde` | Merged only if user explicitly provides the section |
| `packageRepositories` | Merged by `codename` - same codename overrides; new repos appended |

## Template Extends (Inheritance)

User templates can inherit from another template with the optional
`extends:` field. This lets you keep minimal *delta* templates that pick up
updates from their parent automatically, while still overriding anything
you need to change. Each template inherits from **at most one** parent
(single inheritance), so a chain is always a simple linear sequence
`root → ... → leaf` — no diamond problem.

### Syntax

`extends:` is a top-level string field. Its value is a path to a parent
template file, resolved **relative to the child template's directory**.
`.yml` and `.yaml` are both accepted; symbolic links are not.

The canonical two-level example ships in the repo at
`image-templates/ubuntu24/ubuntu24-x86_64-extends-example-raw.yml`:

```yaml
# Inherit everything (disk layout, systemConfig, immutability, ...) from the
# parent template, resolved relative to this file's directory. The parent's
# target must match this template's target. Values below override or extend the
# parent using the standard merge strategies (packages are additive).
extends: "ubuntu24-x86_64-minimal-raw.yml"

image:
  name: ubuntu24-x86_64-extends-example
  version: "24.04"

target:
  os: ubuntu # Must match the parent template's target
  dist: ubuntu24
  arch: x86_64
  imageType: raw

systemConfig:
  name: Extends_Example
  # These packages are merged additively on top of the parent's package list.
  packages:
    - htop
    - curl
```

### Merge Behavior in a Chain

The same per-section rules that govern the [user↔default merge
above](#template-merge-behavior) apply at every level of an `extends`
chain. Because `MergeConfigurations(child, parent)` is a pure function of
two inputs, applying it iteratively as a fold produces the same set of
merged fields at any depth: if the merge is deterministic for two
layers, it is deterministic for N. Note that the ordering of slice
entries merged by key (`systemConfig.users` by name, and
`systemConfig.additionalFiles` by destination path) is not guaranteed to
be stable across runs — the merge implementation uses a map to
deduplicate keys, so the emitted slice order for those two fields may
vary. Every other field's ordering is stable. The table below lists the
full behavior across a chain:

| Section | Rule (chain semantics) |
|---------|------------------------|
| `image.name`, `image.version` | Non-empty child value overrides; last non-empty level in the chain wins |
| `target` | Replaced wholesale by the child's value (all four sub-fields together) |
| `baseline` / `overlayPolicy` | Non-nil child pointer replaces the parent value |
| `disk` | Wholesale replacement when the child provides a non-empty disk config |
| `systemConfig.name` / `.description` / `.hostname` / `.initramfs.template` | Non-empty child overrides |
| `systemConfig.packages` | **Additive union, deduplicated**; each level's packages are appended in chain order and de-duplicated |
| `systemConfig.users` | Merged by `name`: same-name entries are field-level merged; new users included (slice order not guaranteed to be stable across runs) |
| `systemConfig.additionalFiles` | Merged by `final` destination path: same target overrides; new files included (slice order not guaranteed to be stable across runs) |
| `systemConfig.configurations` | **Additive concat**: appended in chain order (root first, leaf last), no deduplication |
| `systemConfig.kernel` | Per-field override: `version`, `cmdline`, `packages`, `enableExtraModules` |
| `systemConfig.bootloader` | Per-field override: `bootType`, `provider` |
| `systemConfig.network` | Per-field: `backend` overrides if non-empty; `interfaces` replaced when the child provides them |
| `systemConfig.immutability` | Merged only when the child provides some immutability configuration |
| `packageRepositories` | Merged by `codename`: same codename overrides; new codenames appended |
| `extends` | **Stripped from the final merged output** — it is a build-time directive, not part of the built template |

The rules quoted above are the exact per-field strategies enforced by
`MergeConfigurations` in `internal/config/merge.go`.

> **Overlay mode caveat**: when the leaf template uses `baseline.mode:
> overlay`, the additive-packages rule is deliberately overridden. The
> merged package list becomes exactly the user's declared packages — the
> baseline already ships the create-mode toolchain, and unioning it back
> in would drag in bootloader packages whose strict version pins the
> frozen baseline cannot satisfy.

### Chain Resolution

At load time, the resolver walks the chain from leaf to root and then
folds it back in **root-to-leaf order** so leaf values have the highest
precedence. Once the chain is folded, the OS defaults for the target
distribution are applied underneath, producing the effective layering:

```
OS defaults → root template → intermediate levels → leaf template
```

Each successive level takes precedence over everything below it. The
merge is applied pairwise: `fold(MergeConfigurations, defaults, [root,
level1, ..., leaf])`.

The build command logs the resolved chain at info level so you can see
the inheritance hierarchy directly in build output:

```
Extends chain: root.yml -> child.yml -> leaf.yml
```

**Worked example.** Consider three templates where the leaf declares
`packages: [my-custom-app]`, the middle level declares `packages:
[prometheus-node-exporter, grafana-agent]`, the root declares `packages:
[docker-cli, containerd]`, and the OS defaults declare
`packages: [openssh-server]`. The final merged template's package list
is the union: `openssh-server, docker-cli, containerd,
prometheus-node-exporter, grafana-agent, my-custom-app` (deduplicated,
default order preserved). If any two levels also set `kernel.version`,
the last non-empty value in the chain wins.

### Limitations and Validation Rules

- **Single inheritance.** Each template may reference at most one parent
  via `extends:`. Multiple inheritance and diamond-shaped graphs are not
  supported.
- **Cycle detection.** The resolver walks the chain with a visited-set
  keyed on the symlink-resolved canonical absolute path of each
  template. Any repeat is rejected with
  `circular extends detected: A -> B -> A`. Canonicalizing the path
  ensures a directory symlink cannot alias two textual paths to the same
  file and evade the check.
- **Target match.** Every template in the chain must share the same
  `target.os`, `target.dist`, `target.arch`, and `target.imageType`. A
  mismatch at any level is rejected with
  `extends target mismatch at level N: child targets os/dist/arch/imageType but parent targets ...`.
- **Depth warning.** Chains that exceed 4 levels emit
  `extends chain depth N exceeds recommended maximum of 4` as a
  warning. This is a soft cap intended to keep hierarchies maintainable
  — the build still succeeds.
- **Path containment.** The parent path is resolved relative to the
  child template's directory. Both a lexical guard and a
  symlink-resolved guard reject any path that escapes that directory
  (`extends path escapes child template's directory: ...`), so a parent
  cannot pull a template in from an unrelated location on disk.
- **Symlink rejection.** Parent templates that are themselves symbolic
  links are rejected at load time, matching the same policy the CLI uses
  for the leaf template.
- **File extension.** Only `.yml` and `.yaml` extensions are accepted;
  other extensions are rejected.
- **Schema.** `extends:` is defined as a plain optional string in
  `os-image-template.schema.json` with no `pattern` or `format`
  constraint — all validation happens in Go at load time so the errors
  above carry more context than a schema violation would.
- **Output stripping.** The `extends:` field is stripped from the final
  merged template because it is a build-time directive, not part of the
  built image's declarative state.

### Debugging an Extends Chain

The `resolve` subcommand renders a template exactly as the build system
sees it after the chain is folded:

```bash
# Chain-only merge, without OS defaults (useful for verifying inheritance)
image-composer-tool resolve image-templates/ubuntu24/ubuntu24-x86_64-extends-example-raw.yml

# Full build-time view: OS defaults as base, extends chain folded on top (leaf wins)
image-composer-tool resolve image-templates/ubuntu24/ubuntu24-x86_64-extends-example-raw.yml --full
```

The output includes the merged `systemConfig.packages` union and every
other field as it would be used at build time. Sensitive fields (user
passwords, `hash_algo` values, and secure-boot key/cert paths) are
redacted so the output is safe to paste into an issue or a code review.
See [Resolve Command](./image-composer-tool-cli-specification.md#resolve-command)
for the full CLI reference.

## Variable Substitution

Templates support variable substitution using `${variable_name}` syntax. You
can provide variable values via a separate YAML file or command-line flags at
build time.

To learn how variables interact with each build stage, see
[Build Stages in Detail](./image-composer-tool-build-process.md#build-stages-in-detail).

| `target.imageType` | **Yes** | Must be `wsl2` |
| `disk.name` | **Yes** | Required when `imageType: wsl2` |
| `disk.artifacts[].type` | **Yes** | Must be `tar` |
| `disk.artifacts[].compression` | **Yes** | Must be `gz` |

Additional notes for WSL builds:

- The default Ubuntu WSL template seeds the standard Ubuntu apt sources via
  `systemConfig.additionalFiles` (for example, `ubuntu-noble.list`), which is
  the same mechanism used by the raw and initrd defaults.
- `disk.partitionTableType` and `disk.partitions` are not used for `wsl2` templates.
- `systemConfig.kernel` is not allowed for `wsl2` templates.

Example `disk` block for WSL:

```yaml
disk:
  name: ubuntu24-x86_64-agentic
  artifacts:
    - type: tar
      compression: gz
```

See the full end-to-end example at
[`image-templates/ubuntu24/ubuntu24-x86_64-agentic-wsl2.yml`](../../image-templates/ubuntu24/ubuntu24-x86_64-agentic-wsl2.yml).

## Best Practices

1. **Start from examples** - copy a template from `image-templates/` and modify
   only the fields you need. Let defaults handle the rest.
2. **Keep templates minimal** - override only what differs from the default.
   Smaller templates are easier to maintain and review.
3. **Use descriptive names** - name images and configs after their purpose
   (e.g., `factory-floor-edge`, not `test-image-3`).
4. **Version control your templates** - store them in Git alongside your
   deployment code.
5. **Validate before building** - run `image-composer-tool validate template.yml`
   to catch errors early.
6. **Prefer `additionalFiles` over `configurations`** - copying config files is
   more reproducible than running arbitrary shell commands.
