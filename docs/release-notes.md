# Release Notes: Image Composer Tool

## Version 2026.1

**June 17, 2026**

**New**

- ARM64/aarch64 cross-architecture image builds: Ubuntu 24, eLxR 12, and AZL3 images can now be composed on an x86_64 host targeting ARM64. The builder validates host-side prerequisites (arch-test, qemu-user-static), normalizes architectures for `mmdebstrap` and `dpkg`, and forces a host-side ukify execution when the host and target architectures differ.

- Ubuntu 24 ARM64 bootable server image: Added a user template and supporting configuration to produce a bootable Ubuntu 24 `aarch64` server image.

- Ubuntu 26.04 LTS (Resolute Raccoon) support: New OS target and associated configuration for Ubuntu 26.04.

- eLxR Edge 26.04 / eLxR 13 support: New OS provider, image configuration, and user templates for eLxR 13 (elxr-edge-26.04) raw image builds.

- Debian 13 user templates: New raw image template and Desktop Virtualization (IDV) ISO installer template for Debian 13.

- ROS 2 Jazzy robotics templates: New AMR raw image template and a companion ISO installer template for ROS 2 Jazzy edge robotics platforms.

- PTL PV attended and unattended ISO templates: New attended and unattended ISO installer templates for PTL (Platform Validation Toolkit) PV (Para-Virtual) configurations including cloud-init example configuration files.

- Unattended ISO installer with policy-based target disk selection: `live-installer` now supports fully automatic installation using a `selectionPolicy` block in the disk template section. Supported strategies: first, largest, fastest (prefers NVMe over SSD over HDD), and largest-free (selects the disk with the most unallocated span). Removable and externally attached disks are excluded by default and can be included explicitly with `excludeRemovable: false`.

- Declarative network configuration in image templates: A new `systemConfig.network` section defines network interfaces at image composition time. It supports `systemd-networkd` and `netplan` backends, configures DHCP, static IP/CIDR addresses, default gateways (via routes), and DNS nameservers per interface.

- Network configuration view in attended ISO installer: The attended (interactive) ISO installer now includes a "Configure Network" step that allows selecting an interface and entering DHCP or static IP/gateway/DNS settings before installation.

- Local package repository population via `packageRepositories` section: The `packageRepositories` schema now accepts a package list whose entries are HTTPS URLs (downloaded at build time) or local file/directory paths (copied). Archives (.tar, .tar.gz, .tgz, .zip) are extracted for their .deb/.rpm payloads. The `path` field is optional when `packages` is set. A temporary directory is auto-created and cleaned up. An optional `insecureSkipVerify` flag allows skipping TLS certificate verification for downloads from environments with self-signed certificates.

- Full offline/cache mode for DEB and RPM repositories: DEB Packages.gz metadata is now cached by SHA-256 checksum (`packages.parsed.json`) under `cache_dir/` and reused on rebuilds with no network access. RPM `primary.xml` metadata and `primary.location.json` are cached under `cache_dir/rpm-metadata/`. Debian repository GPG keys are cached in `cache_dir/gpg-keys/`. Repository file-existence check results and package-list URLs are cached in-process per run to eliminate redundant HEAD requests.

- DKMS module installation: Package resolution now uses a target-name-aware candidate filter (`filterCandidatesByPriorityWithTarget`) that prefers exact-name matches over Provides virtual package matches, preventing kernel packages that provide a DKMS module name from being selected instead of the actual DKMS package.

**Improved**

- RPM package cache: `DownloadPackagesComplete` now checks for a valid local cache before contacting the repository. If all required packages are present, no network request is made. Only the missing packages are re-fetched, preserving existing cached files.

- DEB package cache: `DownloadPackages` performs a staleness check against the local `.deb` cache (by name) before downloading. Version-pinned requirements and epoch-prefixed package names are matched correctly.

- Chroot environment package isolation: The chroot-build tool package cache and the initrd package cache are now stored in dedicated subdirectories (`chrootenv/` and `initrd/` respectively) to prevent the stale-cache check from evicting image packages when the two sets do not overlap.

- Chroot cleanup error handling: `CleanupChrootEnv` and `UmountChrootSysfs` now accumulate all cleanup errors rather than short-circuiting on the first failure. All partial errors are surfaced in the returned error.

- Mount rollback on failure: `mountDiskToChroot` and `MountSysfs` now roll back previously mounted paths when a later mount step fails, preventing orphaned bind mounts.

- Loop device cleanup: `LoopSetupDelete` now detects and disables any SWAP partitions on the loop device before calling `losetup -d`, preventing detach failures caused by active swap.

- Loop device error cleanup on creation failure: If loop device creation fails but a partial loop device path is returned, `BuildRawImage` now detaches it immediately rather than leaking the resource.

- Disk partition creation reliability: `createPartitionTable` now retries wipe (`wipefs`) and `sfdisk` commands in separate loops with a 30-second timeout each, verifying via `lsblk/sfdisk` that the expected state is actually reached before proceeding.

- Grub command detection in install root: `getGrubVersion` and `updateGrubConfig` now resolve grub binaries by checking known absolute paths in the install root (`/usr/sbin/`, `/usr/bin/`) before falling back to shell `command -v`. `update-grub` is now also accepted as a valid fallback.

- `apt-get` install with `--no-install-recommends`: DEB package installation in the chroot environment now passes `--no-install-recommends`, reducing unnecessary package pulls.

- sudo suppressed when already root: `GetFullCmdStr` detects when the process is already running as root (`euid == 0`) and omits the sudo prefix in chroot commands, avoiding permission escalation errors in CI environments that run as root.

- Partition mount-point path resolution: `resolveInstallRootMountPoint` is now the single canonical function for joining the install root and partition mount points. It handles empty, /-absolute, and relative mount-point strings uniformly.

- Default installer partitioning mode: The attended ISO installer now starts in manual partitioning mode by default; partition template state is cleared when entering manual mode to avoid stale configuration.

- Installer startup scripts hardened: `attendedinstaller` and `unattendedinstaller` shell scripts replaced with `set -euo pipefail`, standardized quote handling, and `[[...]]` conditionals for more robust error propagation.

- Dual GPG key per repo for RPM EMT distro: RPM-based EMT repositories now support a second GPG public key (`pkeys` list), enabling repositories that require two signing keys.

- Boot partition label in EMT-EMF template: Explicit partition labels added to the boot partition.

- `systemd-resolved` enabled at startup for RCD: RCD image builds now enable and start `systemd-resolved` as part of post-install configuration.

- `intel-dlstreamer / OpenVINO` version alignment for RCD: Fixed version mismatch between `intel-dlstreamer` and `openvino` in RCD templates. `intel-dlstreamer` is pinned to 2025.2.0.

- `ukify` lookup paths: `shell.go` now searches additional known installation prefixes for `ukify` so builds on distributions that install it in non-standard locations do not fall back to host-side execution unnecessarily.

- Progress bar terminal output: A trailing newline is now emitted after progress bars finish (`VerifyDEBs`, `VerifyAll`, `FetchPackages`) to prevent the next log line from overwriting the progress bar.

- `CopyDir` empty-source handling: Fixed glob pattern from `/*` to `/.` so that copying an empty source directory does not produce a shell error.

- RPM dependency graph (`PkgName`): `GenerateDot` now uses the `PkgName` field for node names in dependency graphs, producing clean package names instead of raw filenames.

- Network schema validation: IPv4/IPv6 CIDR addresses, gateway addresses, and nameservers in `systemConfig.network` are now validated against typed formats in the JSON schema; DHCP and static addresses cannot be combined on the same interface.

**Fixed**

- `fix(ubuntu)`: `AllowPackages` not propagated to debutils.Repository (#480): The `allowPackages` list in user-provided package repository configuration was silently dropped instead of being passed through to the DEB package resolver.

- `fix(inspect)`: ext4 filesystem misdetection in image inspect (#484): The image inspect command was incorrectly classifying some ext4 partitions as a different filesystem type.

- Fixes for error logs when building UKI (#485): Spurious or incorrect error log entries emitted during UKI image construction were corrected.

- `fix(templates)`: pin intel-dlstreamer to 2025.2.0 (#492): `intel-dlstreamer` in `eLxR/RCD` templates was not version-pinned, causing uncontrolled version updates.

- `fix(templates)`: kernel version metadata 6.14 → 6.17 (#494): Template metadata version field for Ubuntu 24 kernels corrected to match the actual installed kernel series.

- RPM DOT file naming bug (#538): `GenerateDot` used the raw filename (e.g., `glibc-2.38-16.azl3.x86_64.rpm`) as a node label instead of the canonical package name (`glibc`), producing incorrect dependency graphs.

- Swap partition cleanup before loop device detach (#568): Building images that include a swap partition would fail at teardown because the loop device was busy. The swap partition is now detected and disabled with `swapoff` before `losetup -d`.

- Ubuntu 24 ARM64 minimal raw template boot partition type: The `xbootldr` partition in `ubuntu24-aarch64-minimal-raw.yml` had an incorrect `fsType: vfat`. It is now corrected to `ext4`.

- Local DEB repo path in chroot: `initDebLocalRepoWithinInstallRoot` used an incorrect path separator for the `/cdrom/cache-repo` mount point inside the chroot, causing package installation failures.

- Deferred cleanup of local DEB repo: De-initialization of the local Debian repository inside the install root is now performed via a defer statement, ensuring cleanup happens even when package installation fails midway.

- `fix(scripts)`: remove Intel-internal proxy from repository configuration (#561): An Intel-internal proxy URL was hardcoded in repository configuration, causing failures in external environments.

**Known Issues**

- Unattended ISO installer is a first-pass implementation: The unattended installer (`ubuntu24-x86_64-minimal-unattended-iso.yml`) does not yet support all advanced partition layouts (e.g., `LVM`, `LUKS`). Complex partition schemes must use the attended installer or a custom startup script.

- ARM64 cross-architecture builds require host tools: Builds targeting aarch64 from an `x86_64` host require arch-test and qemu-user-static installed on the build host. The builder will detect and report missing dependencies but does not install them automatically.

- Loop devices not destroyed when image building is terminated abruptly: When the image build process is terminated abruptly using `ctrl-C`, loop devices created just prior to `ctrl-C` are not removed automatically. The loop devices must be manually removed by the user.
